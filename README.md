# Apple HomeKit ADK for Mongoose OS

This is a port of the official [Apple HomeKit ADK](https://github.com/mongoose-os-libs/homekit-adk) to Mongoose OS.

Targeted platforms are ESP8266 and ESP32 for now.

# Examples

Example Mongoose OS app that uses this library can be found [here](https://github.com/mongoose-os-apps/example-homekit).

# TODO

 - MFi chip support
 - BLE transport support on ESP32
 - Buffer size optimization (https://github.com/apple/HomeKitADK/issues/13).
